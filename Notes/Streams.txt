Streams:
  In Java, we have two categories of streams:

   1) Stream<T> → A stream of objects (generic reference types, e.g., Stream<String>, Stream<Integer>).
    
   2) Primitive Streams → Special streams for primitives, because boxing/unboxing of wrapper objects (Integer, Double) is expensive:
      IntStream → for int  
      LongStream → for long
      DoubleStream → for double
