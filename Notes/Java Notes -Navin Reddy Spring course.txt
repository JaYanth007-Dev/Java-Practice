Explict conversion -(Casting)
ex:	
	float b=2.9f;
	int k=(int) b
	
Implicit conversion - Type Conversion
ex: byte b=32;
	int a=b;

Arrays:
Jagged arrays:The size of the internal array is not unique

Drawbacks:We cant change the size	
		  elements will be in continues memory location
		  it will traverse from start to end in case of searching and sroting etc
		   it we want to increase the size of an array we need to create new array and need to copy the existing one
		   we cant store multiple types like int,string etc
		   
		   
		
#String
String is a class so it will create objects in Heap memory in String constant pool
-If we try to modify it will again create new constant
-Using String Buffer and builder we can modify the string
-By default String Buffer will give the buffer space of 16 chars - ex:StringBuffer j=new StringBuffer("Jay"). It will give the capacity of 16+3=19.
-String buffer is "Thread safe" builder is not so it is fast


:Static variable are store in Method area of JVM - it will store meta information of class.
-in static methods we can use only static variables we cant use non static variables
Means - we can't directly access if we want to access we can pass the object in to the method then we can access
-Static block:-it will call only once when class get loaded even we create many objects it will call only once
			-it will call first -because whenever we create an object of a class for the first time,the class loader will load that class,at the time only static bloack will call.
-If you wont create a object for a class that class will not loaded by class loader
-If we want to load the class without creating an object then - have to use	
	ex: Class.forName("Mobile") in main method
	so it will load the class .if we have static block with a print statement ,only that will print not any constructor or any other methods.	
	

:PSVM -
-If we remove static in that it will become non static method so we need a object to call non static method
so excecution will not start in the main method


:Inheritance
- Whenever we create an obj of child class it will call both the child and parent class constructors
